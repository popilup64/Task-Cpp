A Brief Biography of Leonardo da Vinci

Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519) was born in the Italian village of Vinci. From childhood, he demonstrated exceptional talent in art, music, and mathematics. His father, recognizing his talent, placed him as an apprentice in the workshop of the renowned artist Verrocchio.

Like a typical Renaissance artist, Leonardo depended on patrons and traveled extensively throughout Italy. He worked for the Duke of Milan, in Rome, and in Florence, where he developed a tense rivalry with Michelangelo. He spent the last years of his life in France at the court of King Francis I, where he died.

 Although (олзо) he produced few paintings, his fame came from masterpieces such as the Mona Lisa and Lady with an Ermine. As an inventor, he developed designs for a helicopter, a tank, and a bridge that were centuries ahead of their time.
